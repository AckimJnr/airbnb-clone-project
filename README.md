2. **Property Details**: Provide comprehensive information about a selected property, including amenities, location, and pricing.
3. **Booking Process**: Enable users to select dates, specify the number of guests, and confirm reservations easily.

### **Primary Pages**
The three main pages of the application are outlined below:

| **Page**          | **Description**                                                                                                                                   |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Property Listing View** | Displays a variety of property listings in a visually appealing layout. Each listing includes an image, title, price, and a brief description.       |
| **Listing Detailed View** | Shows detailed information about a specific property, including amenities, location, pricing, and additional photos to aid decision-making.         |
| **Simple Checkout View**  | Guides users through the booking process. Allows the selection of dates, the number of guests, and finalizes the reservation seamlessly.             |

### **Importance of a User-Friendly Design**
A user-friendly design is crucial in a booking system for the following reasons:
- **Enhances User Experience**: Simplified navigation and clear visuals reduce friction, making the booking process enjoyable and efficient.
- **Builds Trust**: A clean and professional design increases user confidence in the platform.
- **Improves Accessibility**: Intuitive layouts ensure that users of all technical levels can use the application effectively.
- **Increases Conversion Rates**: By making the booking process straightforward, more users are likely to complete their reservations.

## UI Component Patterns

### **Planned Components**
The application will use reusable UI components to ensure consistency and scalability. Here’s an overview of the key components:

| **Component**     | **Description**                                                                                                                                   |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Navbar**         | A responsive navigation bar that includes links to the Home page, Listings page, Profile page, and Checkout page. Will also include a search bar and user authentication controls. |
| **Property Card**  | Displays property details like an image, title, price, and location. Includes a "View Details" button for navigation to the detailed listing page. |
| **Footer**         | A consistent footer containing company information, contact details, social media links, and legal disclaimers.                                   |
| **Filter Bar**     | Allows users to filter listings by criteria such as price, location, property type, and guest capacity.                                           |
| **Booking Form**   | A form for users to input their booking details (e.g., dates, guests) and proceed to checkout.                                                   |
| **Modal**          | Used for pop-ups like login, sign-up, or confirmation dialogues during the booking process.                                                      |
| **Carousel**       | A component to display multiple images for a property in an interactive slideshow format.                                                        |
| **Alert/Toast**    | Displays notifications such as success or error messages, e.g., after completing a booking or encountering a validation issue.                    |

### **Importance of UI Component Patterns**
- **Reusability**: Components can be reused across pages, reducing development time and ensuring consistency.
- **Modularity**: Breaking the UI into distinct components makes the application easier to maintain and scale.
- **Customizability**: Components can be styled and adapted to fit specific needs without affecting the rest of the application.

### **Next Steps**
- Build wireframes and prototypes to visualize how the components will look and function.
- Implement the components with responsiveness and accessibility in mind.
- Conduct user testing to gather feedback and refine the components.
